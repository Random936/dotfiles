#+TITLE: Email Configuration

* Initial Setup

Before installing any packages with emacs, there is some initial setup that needs to be done. The first part of this is installing isync. Isync is the actual program that is used to sync mail with remote imap servers such as the one used by gmail.

This can be installed with the following command:
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S isync
#+end_src

After this is installed, a config file must be created at the location ~~/.mbsyncrc~ to configure isync to connect to some gmail account. I've included this in the git repo, so after installing everything with ~stow .~, it should already be configured properly. However, some information such as the username and password might need to be updated.

The password uses GPG to decrypt some encrypted password file for added security. To create this file, run the following commands:
#+begin_src bash
vim ~/.passwords/gmail # Add your password to the file.
gpg -c ~/.passwords/gmail # Creates a gmail.gpg file.
rm ~/.passwords/gmail # Remove the plaintext password file.
#+end_src

** Disclaimer

If you are using two factor authentication, this will not work. In this case, you will need to create an /app password/. A guide on how to do this can be found [[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833][here]]. From here, I can just replace this value with what used to be my normal password.

** Installation for MacOS

MacOS doesn't include a certificate file in the typical ~/etc/ssl/certs~ directory. Due to this, you have to create a file using the ~Keychain Access~ app.
#+begin_src bash
Open the Application Keychain Access.app
Select System Roots in the sidebar
Select all items listen here – ⌘ + a
Export the items with ⇧ + ⌘ + e to the file ~/.mail/certificates/root-certificates.pem
#+end_src

* Mu4e

In this section, I'm setting up ~mu4e~ to give emacs the capability to send emails using my gmail account. To start, you need to install the ~mu4e~ package outside of emacs.

#+begin_src bash
yay -S mu
#+end_src

After installing the ~mu~ client, I also need to run a initial index using the following command:
#+begin_src bash
mbsync -a
mu init --maildir=~/.mail --my-address=jadenprovost@gmail.com
mu index
#+end_src

From here, I can continue onto configuring the ~mu4e~ emacs package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Check which load-path exists for multi-platform support.
(setq jm/mu4e-load-path
      (let ((linux-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
            (macos-path "/opt/homebrew/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/mu4e"))
        (cond ((file-exists-p linux-path) linux-path)
              ((file-exists-p macos-path) macos-path)
              (t (error "No mu4e load-path present. Is mu4e installed?")))))

(use-package mu4e
  :ensure nil
  :load-path jm/mu4e-load-path
  :bind ("C-x m" . mu4e)
  :config
  ;; Avoids syncing issues.
  (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)

  ;; Fix message citation style for gmail.
  (setq message-cite-style message-cite-style-gmail)
  (setq message-citation-line-format "On %a, %b %d, %Y at %H:%M %p %f wrote:")
  (setq message-citation-line-function 'message-insert-formatted-citation-line)

  ;; Refresh mail every X seconds. Set to 5 minutes currently
  (setq mu4e-update-interval (* 5 60))
  (setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -a")
  (setq mu4e-maildir "~/.mail")

  (setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/[Gmail]/Drafts")
  (setq mu4e-sent-folder "/[Gmail]/Sent Mail")
  (setq mu4e-refile-folder "/[Gmail]/All Mail")
  (setq mu4e-trash-folder "/[Gmail]/Trash")

  (add-to-list 'mu4e-bookmarks
               '( :name "Flagged messages"
                  :query "flag:flagged"
                  :key ?f))

  (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
        '((:maildir "/Inbox" :key ?i)
          (:maildir "/[Gmail]/Sent Mail" :key ?s)
          (:maildir "/[Gmail]/Trash" :key ?t)
          (:maildir "/[Gmail]/Drafts" :key ?d)
          (:maildir "/[Gmail]/All Mail" :key ?a))))
#+end_src

Adding some configuration to correct ~mu4e~'s default values.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Jaden Provost Maxwell-Comfort")
(setq user-mail-address "jadenprovost@gmail.com")
#+end_src

* SMTP

In order to send mail with ~mu4e~, you must also configure an SMTP client.  Based on the ~mu4e~ wiki, I was able to shamelessly steal some of the config for the gmail configuration found [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Gmail-configuration.html][here]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package smtpmail
  :after mu4e
  :config
  (setq smtpmail-stream-type 'ssl)
  (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com")
  (setq smtpmail-smtp-service 465))

(setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
#+end_src

When running this however, you need to authenticate by creating an ~~/.authinfo~ file. This file is formatted as follows:
#+begin_src text
machine smtp.gmail.com port 465 login myuser password mypassword
#+end_src

Similarly to the password configured above for the IMAP server, you can also pass an ~authinfo.gpg~ file for some added security.
