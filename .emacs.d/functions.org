#+TITLE: Custom Elisp Functions

As of now, I haven't added anything here, though I do expect to start adding some custom functions as I learn more about Elisp.

* Capture Template Functions

These functions are for my org roam daily capture template. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jm/get-todos-with-priority (priority files)
  (let ((items '()))
    (org-map-entries
     (lambda ()
       (when (equal priority (cdr (assoc "PRIORITY" (org-entry-properties))))
         (push (cdr (assoc "ITEM" (org-entry-properties))) items)))
     "TODO=\"TODO\""
     files)
    items))

(defun jm/format-org-todo-items (items)
  (mapconcat (lambda (item) (concat "- [ ] " item))
             items
             "\n"))
#+end_src
